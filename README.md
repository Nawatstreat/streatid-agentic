# STREATID AGENTIC • ID ENGINE v2

> A modern agent identity & trust engine built on Intercom architecture.  
> Focused on behavioral scoring, trust indexing, and dynamic risk classification.

---

## 🔷 Overview

STREATID Agentic is a decentralized identity simulation engine designed to:

- Register autonomous agents
- Track behavioral interactions
- Calculate dynamic trust index
- Classify agent risk level
- Simulate reputation-based governance logic

The engine operates through a structured CLI dashboard with a modern boxed UI.

## 🧠 Core Concepts

• Behavioral Score  
• Trust Index  
• Interaction History  
• Risk Classification Engine  
• Agent Lifecycle Tracking  

Trust dynamically increases with positive interactions  
Trust decreases significantly when penalized  

Risk Levels:

- LOW RISK (Green)
- MEDIUM RISK (Yellow)
- HIGH RISK (Red)
